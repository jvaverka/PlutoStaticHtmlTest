# Course Overview

## Syllabus

**Pre-recorded online lectures are available to compliment the lecture notes**

**Prerequisites**: While this course will be mixing ideas from high performance
computing, numerical analysis, and machine learning, no one in the course is
expected to have covered all of these topics before. Understanding of calculus,
linear algebra, and programming is essential. 18.337 is a graduate-level
subject so mathematical maturity and the ability to learn from primary
literature is necessary. Problem sets will involve use of
[Julia](http://julialang.org/), a Matlab-like environment (little or no prior
experience required; you will learn as you go).

**Textbook & Other Reading**: There is no textbook for this course or the field
of scientific machine learning. Some helpful resources are
[Hairer and Wanner's Solving Ordinary Differential Equations I & II](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783540566700)
and [Gilbert Strang's Computational Science and Engineering](https://www.amazon.com/Computational-Science-Engineering-Gilbert-Strang/dp/0961408812).
Much of the reading will come in the form of primary literature from journal
articles posted here.

### Lecture Summaries and Handouts

Note that lectures are broken down by topic, not by day. Some lectures are more
than 1 class day, others are less.
